# Bus Reservation System

Welcome to the **Bus Reservation System** repository! This project provides a command-line interface to manage bus information, reserve seats, and retrieve details about buses and seat reservations. It is designed to demonstrate foundational C++ programming concepts and file handling.

## 🔧 Technologies and Tools Used

This project was developed using C++ and includes:

1. **File Handling**: To store and retrieve bus and seat reservation data.
2. **Control Structures**: To manage the program flow and logic.
3. **Standard Library**: For input/output operations and string manipulation.

## 🌐 Program Overview

The program offers the following features:

1. **Add Bus Information**:
   - Input and validate bus details (e.g., plate numbers, seat capacities).
   - Supports both mini-buses (30 seats) and big buses (50 seats).
   - Saves data to `bus_data.txt`.

2. **Reserve Seats**:
   - Allows users to book seats in either mini-buses or big buses.
   - Stores passenger details in `seat.txt`.

3. **View Available Buses**:
   - Displays information about all added buses from `bus_data.txt`.

4. **View Reserved Seats**:
   - Shows details of all reserved seats from `seat.txt`.

### Key Features

- Input validation for plate numbers, seat capacities, and user options.
- Dynamic feedback for available seats and booking status.
- Persistent data storage using text files.
